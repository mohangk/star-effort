## 🚀 Getting Started

### ⚙️ Configuration Setup

**First time setup** or **when cloning this repository**:

1. **Copy the config templates:**
   ```bash
   # Copy Firebase web config
   cd public
   cp config.js-sample config.js
   cd ..
   
   # Copy Firebase project config
   cp .firebaserc-sample .firebaserc
   ```

2. **Update with your Firebase config:**
   - Open `public/config.js` in your editor
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration
   - Get your config from: [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) > Project Settings > General > Your apps > Config

3. **Update your configs:**
   
   **Firebase Web Config** (`public/config.js`):
   ```javascript
   export const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
     authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     storageBucket: "your-project.firebasestorage.app",
     messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
     appId: "your-app-id"
   };
   ```
   
   **Firebase Project Config** (`.firebaserc`):
   ```json
   {
     "projects": {
       "default": "your-project-id"
     }
   }
   ```

**Important:** 
- ✅ `config.js-sample` and `.firebaserc-sample` are committed as templates
- ❌ `config.js` and `.firebaserc` are gitignored for development cleanliness
- 📝 **Note**: Firebase web API keys are [safe to commit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api-keys#api-keys-for-firebase-are-different) but we externalize config for better project organization

### 🔧 Firebase Project Setup

**Create your own Firebase project** (required for your family's private data):

1. **Create Firebase Project:**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Click "Create a project" 
   - Choose a project name (e.g., "smith-family-star-effort")

2. **Enable Authentication:**
   - Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable "Email/Password" provider
   - Create a family account for login

3. **Set up Firestore Database:**
   - Go to Firestore Database > Create database
   - Start in "production mode"
   - Choose your preferred location

4. **Configure Web App:**
   - Go to Project Settings > General
   - Click "Add app" and choose Web
   - Copy the config object for your `public/config.js` file
   - Use the project ID for your `.firebaserc` file

5. **Deploy Security Rules:**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase init firestore
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

6. **Enable Hosting (Optional):**
   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

### 🌐 Cache Control (Production)

The app is configured with cache control headers to ensure updates are loaded immediately:

- **HTML & JS files**: No caching (`no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`)
- **CSS & Images**: 1-hour cache (`public, max-age=3600`)

This is configured in firebase.json

### 💻 Local Development

For testing, debugging, or making modifications to the app:

#### 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd star-effort

# Start local server (all app files are in public/ directory)
cd public
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Server will start and show:
# Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
```

#### 🌐 Access Your Local App
- **URL:** http://localhost:8000
- **Alternative:** http://[::]:8000 (IPv6)

#### 🔧 Development Workflow
1. **Make changes** to files in `public/` directory
2. **Refresh browser** to see changes
3. **Check console** (F12) for debugging information
4. **Deploy when ready:** `firebase deploy --only hosting`

**Important Notes:**
- ✅ **Same Firebase Backend:** Local and production share the same database
- 🔐 **Authentication Required:** You must set up Firebase Auth to test missions
- 📱 **Real-time Sync:** Changes sync across all devices immediately
- 🐛 **Debug Logging:** Check browser console for detailed error messages

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Login Issues
- **"Invalid email or password"**: Double-check your family credentials in Firebase Console
- **Authentication not enabled**: Make sure Email/Password is enabled in Firebase Console
- **Page keeps redirecting**: Clear browser cache and cookies, then try again

### App Not Loading
- **Check internet connection**: The app requires internet for Firebase
- **Try different browser**: Some ad blockers may interfere with Firebase
- **Clear cache**: Refresh with Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Data Issues
- **Tasks not saving**: Check that you're logged in and have internet connection
- **Old data missing**: Data is now stored in Firebase, not local storage
- **Permission errors**: Ensure you're using the correct family account
- **Missions not creating**: Check browser console (F12) for detailed error messages

### Configuration Issues
- **"Module not found" errors**: Make sure you've copied `config.js-sample` to `config.js` and `.firebaserc-sample` to `.firebaserc`
- **"Invalid configuration" errors**: Check that your Firebase config values are correct in both files
- **"Import failed" errors**: Ensure `config.js` has the proper export format
- **"Config not loading"**: Verify that `config.js` is in the `public/` directory and `.firebaserc` is in the root
- **"Firebase project not found"**: Check that your project ID in `.firebaserc` matches your Firebase project
- **"Should I commit config?"**: Firebase web API keys are [safe to commit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api-keys#api-keys-for-firebase-are-different), but we keep them separate for cleaner project organization

### Local Development Issues
- **Server won't start**: Make sure you're in the `public/` directory before running `python3 -m http.server 8000`
- **Files not found**: All app files are in `public/` folder, not root directory
- **Port already in use**: Try a different port: `python3 -m http.server 8001`
- **Permission denied**: Try running with `sudo` or use a port above 1024
- **IPv6 issues**: Access via http://localhost:8000 instead of http://[::]:8000

### Contact & Support
- **Firebase Console**: Access your project at [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
- **Local Testing**: http://localhost:8000 (when running local server)
- **Deploy Your Own**: Follow Firebase Hosting setup to create your family's private instance
